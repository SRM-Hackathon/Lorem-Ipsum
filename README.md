GlobetrottAR

The application is onestop for everything travel.
The challenges invlved in planning a trip is REAL.Most of us give up on the whole idea of the trip just because there are too manyy aspects to care about, from where do we go, to where do we eat,how do we travel etc.
Our goal is to simplyfy the lives of frequent travellers , but we do not stop there, we have taken this idea up a notch and gamified the whole experience.
we provide you suggestion on places to visit using our intelligent recommendation system,
Once you are at the destination our AR based application lets you take a cool picture featuring our app's avatar and post it online!!!
On completing suggested quests to places the user earns reward points!!!
Which can be traded for deals and offers at restaurants, hotels and vehicle rentals nearby.

Our app makes the whole experience smooth and a lot more fun.Users can socialise with fellow travellers on globetrottAR and follow each other.
